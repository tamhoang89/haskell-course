Then, they continue with a capital `A` because we're lifting them to the applicative level and end with the number of arguments the lifted function takes.

It seems counterintuitive because `Functor` is a superclass of `Applicative`. But, the same as we have mutually recursive functions for the Eq type class, the compiler doesn't care as long as both instances are defined and we eventually reach a base case. So, if, for some reason, defining the pure and apply operators is easier than defining `fmap`, you have the option of doing this. That's also why we use `pure` and the apply operator instead of `fmap` to define `liftA`. If we did that, and then you define `fmap` using `liftA`, we'll get infinite recursion.

That way, it would be better to use the optimized `liftA2` than to `fmap` over the structure and then use `<*>`. We don't care about optimizing our code for now, so, for us, it's just a shorter way of lifting a binary function.\n",

The `flip` function only changes how we provide values to the original function but not how the values are evaluated. So, even if we write the values in a different order, the effects run in the same order. This is the problem this new operator solves.
